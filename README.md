# 🎮 Infinite Tic Tac Toe

A modern twist on the classic Tic Tac Toe game — built with **React** and styled using **Tailwind CSS**. This version adds an infinite gameplay loop: after placing 3 marks, the first one disappears, keeping the game dynamic and strategic. First to win 3 rounds takes the crown. 🏆
